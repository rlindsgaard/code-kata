# Duty Roster kata

Same kata and requirements as yesterday trying to refine into a single prompt.

## Initial prompt

generate a powershell cmdlet that generates a duty roster. The cmdlet takes a list of names as argument, a start date and a count. as output it should produce a new list drawing a random element from the list of names and pairing it with a date. when the list is empty it will be reset to the full list og names. each date is generated by taking the following monday from the last computed date starting with  a date given as cmdlet argument, this argument is optional defaulting to the current date. The answer should include comment based help content and conform to powershell naming conventions.

### Notes

- “…each date is generated by taking the following monday from the last computed date starting with a date given as cmdlet argument” when used as logic description in isolation this yielded a nice abstraction making the source more readable
- “as output it should produce a new list drawing a random element from the list of names and pairing it with a date” simpler and more concise phrasing was expected to yield an abstraction - resulting code had similar logic as the preceding attempt. Controlling structure might need to be pertained as a refinement step or stated explicitly - e.g by asking for adherence to code design principles.

## Unit testing

now generate a pester test file assuming it will be placed in the same directory with unit tests of the generated cmdlet. Remember to include a test that given an input such as the example input given as the “.EXAMPLE” section og the comment based help section of the cmdlet - the test asserts and checks the full output of the cmdlet. Also make sure to mock Get-Date and   the Random object such that the tests are deterministic

### Notes

- I only got the single one test - that was not expected. Starting with an open ended request and refining afterwards is likely the way to go.
